# Reactive Android Programming
This is the code repository for [Reactive Android Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/reactive-android-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787289901), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Writing code on Android is hard. Writing a high quality code that involves concurrent and parallel tasks is even harder. Ensuring that this code will run without unforeseen race conditions is an the order of magnitude harder. RxJava is the tool that can help write code for such tasks.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
plugins {
    id "me.tatarka.retrolambda" version "3.4.0"
}
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
```

Before you start, it is expected that you have Android Studio setup and ready and Android SDK is installed as well. Other than that, there are no additional requirements.
Obviously, it will be very handy if you have real development smartphone devices available so that you wouldnâ€™t need to rely on emulators.
